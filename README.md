**About Me**
___
Hey! I'm Shirelle, a Full-Stack software engineer.  I love all things web development, including building out backend APIs and accessible frontends. Some of the technologies I use to do this are: 
 - Javascript ES6/JSX
 - React and React Testing Library
 - Java 
 - SpringBoot
 - Node.js 
 - Python
 - Relational Databases, such as MySQL and Postgres
 
 I've done some really cool things recently, like complete a [software engineering apprenticeship](https://github.com/ShirelleW/Multiverse-Final-Portfolio) with Multiverse and American Express. I got to practice using advanced javascript with React and building out backends with Java and Vert.x, and learned a lot about industry wide best practices for the software development lifecycle. I also learned a lot about data engineering, specifically the ETL process through a fellowship with Correlation One called DS4A. I wrote some really cool data collection and manipulation scripts which you can find [here](https://github.com/ds4a-data-engineering-2-team-27/ppp-loan-evaluation/tree/f55ddef1b16dcf6985fd4fd16db8494cd91913f0/Financials_Scripts_and_Defintions). This fellowship was not only an eye-opener to me technically, but it taught me a lot about my leadership style and how to navigate handling difficult task with small group of other inexperienced devs.

Development isn't the only thing I'm passionate about; I love playing guitar. Like most self-taught guitarist, my music theory knowledge isn't always up-to-par. So to help reinforce some key theory patterns, I decided to create *[RiffTheory](https://riff-theory.vercel.app/)*, an app specifically designed for guitarist to be able to visualize scale patterns across the fretboard. This app specifically comes in handy if you're a guitarist who plays out of E standard like me or has a 7+ string guitar- you can customize your number of strings and tuning with just a few clicks of the mouse! An API for guitar scales is coming soon!

For those who don't know, I spent my first couple of career years as a structural welder and Millwright. After some dabblings with PLCs in a mechatronics role I held, I decided to purse technology fulltime and enrolled in a coding bootcamp. This background trained my mind into a get 'er done mentality while simultaneously keeping mindful of quality and customer specifications.
